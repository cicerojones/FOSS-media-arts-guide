Quoting from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolegomena_to_Any_Future_Metaphysics">Wikipedia:</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"Kant declared that the Prolegomena are for the use of both learners
and teachers as an heuristic way to discover a science of
metaphysics. Unlike other sciences, metaphysics has not yet attained
universal and permanent knowledge. There are no standards to
distinguish truth from error. Kant asked, 'Can metaphysics even be
possible?'"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Can a comprehensive tutorial for media students looking to use open
source software even be possible?

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
</div><div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Statement of Purpose</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
This document begins with a statement of its primary purpose: to
acquaint media arts students with using free, open source
software. Sounds simple, doesn't it? 
</p>

<p>
The reality is, inevitably, more complicated. What exactly are "media
arts?" Do you mean "multimedia arts?" And what kind of free software
are we talking about? Firefox? What concepts are involved
there&#x2013;How to use a web browser? And why does it sometimes say "free"
software and other times say "open source?" There's <a href="#sec-5-1-1">a difference?</a>
</p>

<p>
And what the hell does 'acquaint' mean?
</p>

<p>
None of these questions even begin to address the assumptions being made about
what is going to remain useful months or years from the time of this
writing, in late 2013.
</p>

<p>
So, some further explanation is needed. And to paraphrase 
<a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/">(Roger Sessions apparently paraphrasing)</a> Albert Einstein, you want the
simplest explanation for how to do something, "but not simpler." As that
cryptic allusion suggests, it all turns out to be not so simple, and
trying to explain how to use software can get complicated
pretty fast.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> some basic assumptions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
In light of these complications, it can help any person doing the
explaining to have a sense of what her auditor (the explainee?) already knows, in order to
tailor the explanation to the shared context of what you both already
know.  Since this document can't (yet) ask you what you already know,
we're going to make a few assumptions. You may:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.1</span> have basic digitally literacy</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<p>
Even if you have never heard the term, chances are you "digitally
literate." Some internet searches for what that means in 2013 turn up things like this&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What the us government has to say:
<a href="http://www.digitalliteracy.gov">http://www.digitalliteracy.gov</a>
</p>

<p>
What some anonymous wikipedia administrators have to say:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy</a>
</p>

<p>
We can only speculate about how any of this will change in coming
months and years (<a href="#sec-5-5-2">see speculative fiction&#x2013;below</a>)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2-2"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.2</span> be accustomed to so-called right-brain thinking</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">
<p>
Two, we are going to assume that you may have more training in "the
arts" than in "computers." The distinction may or may not be a
relevant one right now, but, a world where it is definitively NOT is
probably on the way. May this document help expedite the process.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2-3"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.3</span> be reading this on your own actual computer (probably a Mac)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-3">
<p>
Three, given that two is true, we might not be wrong in thinking that
you are working on&#x2013;or at least as familiar with working on&#x2013;a Mac as
any other computer. Why? Well, see <a href="#sec-4-3-1">this essay</a> for some background.
</p>

<p>
Because this may be true, we can just for now state that there are
some complication with using some of the more "bleeding edge" open
source software out there, if you are only accustomed to using the
Mac GUI (huh? see <a href="#sec-4-4">here</a>).
</p>

<p>
DO NOT LET THIS DISSUADE YOU! It just means that you are going to
become more skilled at working with this powerful tool of metal,
glass, plastic and silicon. And for everyone who's seen Napolean
Dynamite, we can all attest to the importance of having skills.
</p>

<p>
It'll make a difference, also, if you are using your own computer,
as you will be need to be able to get around it (and make changes)
freely. In short, here's one case where's it good to be an
administrator [see jargon].
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> structure of document</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
Once this document 'goes live,' and then continues to be edited and
updated, it will probably reflect something of the structure of the
world of free software itself&#x2013;maintained by a community (at least
potentially, <a href="#sec-6">see below</a>) unbound by linearity, vaguely anarchic but not
without reason. It's a thriving, bustling scene out there, with an
order all its own; the writing here can only hope to help you find
your place in a sometimes disorienting virtual space.
</p>

<p>
It is worth mentioning at the outset that this document is primarily
concerned with software, as opposed to technology in general. As such,
it is not really about digital art-making itself (though there are
relevant links in the <a href="#sec-6-4-3">appendix section</a>); nor does it purport to be a
tutorial about any of the individual pieces of software mentioned.
Instead it is meant to orient and guide the media student through a
variety of topics that sometimes feel incidental to actually doing
work with any of these pieces of software.
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, feel free to jump to the section that lists and
briefly describes <a href="#sec-3-2">particular examples</a> of such software. You may find
that in the process, you hit upon a topic or question that might be
addressed here.
</p>

<p>
While some original writing and explanation is sprinkled throughout,
the bulk of the documentation here will involve links to webpages to
visit for more information on specific software and for detailed
explanations.  
</p>

<p>
Since weblinks, however, have inevitably indeterminate lifespans, 
there will also be listed <a href="#sec-3-1-2">a few hubs</a> of information that are important
right now and should be around for a while.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there may even be space for some thinking about things <a href="#sec-5">deeper</a>
than how to install software, and that we don't expect to change as
quickly&#x2013;culture, philosophy, and the way humans learn and solve
problems. 
</p>

<p>
Begin anywhere.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> some suggestions on how to use this document</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Since we don't know what you want to do (and you may not either!), we
seek to present a variety of ways to start.
</p>

<p>
You might be interested in a particular medium or just wish to browse
what's available, without having to think too much about all the steps
in involved. In which case, we direct you <a href="#sec-3-2">here</a>
</p>

<p>
In some cases, however, the experience of others can be useful (or
irrelevant!). We will direct you to some <a href="#sec-2-4-2">paths</a> that contributors have
described. 
</p>

<p>
As with the Web itself, there is no one path that anyone should
follow. To quote Joseph Campbell, "follow your bliss." 
</p>

<p>
(BTW, For most of us just starting out, that usually means NOT
starting <a href="#sec-4-2">too deep</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack">"the stack."</a>)
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-4-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.1</span> why forking paths?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-1">
<p>
Depending on your tastes, reading tutorials can be challenging.
Boredom, frustration, utter incomprehension all are problems you may
encounter.
</p>

<p>
Because using your brain in only one way to scour only one problem can
quickly produce diminishing returns, we encourage breaks. One helpful
trick is to read stuff that is <a href="#sec-5-1">related,</a> but not exactly what you
need. Especially if it is something that it is easier to relate to,
you can chalk it up to learning the culture, which may be helpful in
the long run. 
</p>

<p>
Regardless, evidence (and personal experience) suggests that we can
often subconsciously get ideas how to work out one problem while
consciously working on something else. And there are usually no
shortage of interesting concepts lurking just behind some really
tedious ones.
</p>

<h4 id="sec-2-4-2"><span class="section-number-4">2.4.2</span> others' paths and processes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-4-2">
<p>
I encourage contributors to share a little about the path they
followed to arrive "here," understood as broadly or narrowly as
necessary, as well as concrete examples of any process of working
with software that they found useful or relevant in their own work or
research. This can simply be links to tutorials or code on github or
some such repository; or actual code or examples of work carried
out. The emphasis, however, should be on explaining specific aspects
of one's thought process or manner of working&#x2013;artistic "source code,"
as it were&#x2013;rather than on finished presentations of already
documented work.

<p>
In order to use the software that follows below, you may face a
variety of initial challenges. Or you may find the process smooth,
effortless and painless. It all depends on a variety of factors, some
within and some outside your control. 
</p>

<p>
If you are a student in media arts, there is a good chance you have a
Mac and already understand something about how to download and install
a new application, especially one that has been neatly packaged by its
proprietor. If it has not been so packaged, you may have to dig a
little deeper into the process of, shall we say, getting the source to
run?
</p>

<p>
[what happens when you double click on a .dmg file is usually fairly
consistent, though what happens afterwards depends a lot on what
approach the person who "compiled" the program choose to do insofar
as it would affect you.
</p>

<p>
Let's contrast what would happen if you were to open this with
something other than the DiskImageMounter, which is the default
package that deals with .dmg files. Believe it or not, you can even
choose to open up such a file in a text-editing program, and you will
see a good representation of what 'compiled' means. It means that you
can't read it. At least, not as something like English in the way
that the source code was written by someone in something at least
resembling English, (at least it was made up of recognizable
symbols). 
</p>

<p>
This unreadable by humans characteristic is part of what makes
compiled code, or "binaries" special. The only thing you can
reasonably do with it is give it to the machine inside your
machine. That is, let the underlying low-level operating system
facilities handle it, by bringing it unto the various operations that
make up the processor's domain (the level of architecture we can
think of as the machine language layer, or machine layer. 
</p>

<p>
The subtleties here (at least as far as the average user is
concerned) point to the complicated nature of getting a machine to
understand something humans try to communicate. And points to the
fact that there is an enormous amount of stuff going on
underneath the hood of that clean-lined, relatively static-looking
desktop environment the Apple design team (or the KDE, or the GNOME
team) has sweated over. Understanding how a keystroke on a keyboard
gets translated into something down in a fancy processor and returned
instantaneously on a screen, without us having to say much of
anything is all part of the remarkable ballet of user-designer
interaction. 
</p>

<p>
Back to your .dmg file. Dragging the main folder of whatever window
appears next (this is all following a Mac installation experience)
brings the installation game to a neat conclusion. As far as the
ordinary user is concerned, at least. And did you notice that the
original disk image file, which was "opened" by you DiskImage
mounter, in fact appears as a device as far as your operating system
interface is concerned. What the hell does THAT mean?

<ol class="org-ol"><li>getting 'source code' onto a Mac<br/><div class="outline-text-6" id="text-3-1-1-2-1">
<p>
One of the main complications I have experienced was how to take
published code, say, from Github, <a href="http://sourceforge.net">http://sourceforge.net</a> or from
somebody's personal website, and to get it working on my laptop, which
was usually a Mac running OS X.
</p>

<p>
The typical software user is either (depending on your perspective)
shielded or blocked from understanding the nitty-gritty details of how
to run software. There certainly are plausible arguments for making it as easy
as possible for the "end user;" the appropriate shibboleth here is 'intuitive.'
The Mac design philosophy, and as of the early 2010s, Macs are the de
facto standard for media and design students <a href="#sec-4-3-1">(see Neal Stephenson's essay)</a> is to make the user
experience as smooth and "intuitive" as possible; you want people to
have to do little more than "double-click" to get things to work.
</p>

<p>
While there are many advantages to this being shielded from the
obscure inner-workings of software installation and operation, when it
comes time to use software which is not proprietary, and which is not
being actively maintained by a paid support team, you are now at a
double disadvantage. Not only do you not know what to do if something
goes wrong (which it often does), you may not have the required skills
to do it all, may not know even the required vocabuarly (at the very
least you may not be comfortable with working from the command line,
especially if you have been accustomed to the Mac GUI. Knowing a
little bit of how it all actually works 'under the hood,' makes sense.
</p>

<p>
Again, there have been and will continue to be good reasons to keep
people from 'opening the hood:' they are less likely to put
power-steering fluid in the radiator, for one thing. But I would make
the argument now that artists, especially those artists for whom
digital technology has affected their field (which is just about
everyone), need to be among the vanguard of 'non-techies' acquiring
the vocabulary. We need to learn how to not just benefit from but
contribute to the free software movement. More elaborate arguments
supporting this can be found <a href="#sec-5-1-2">here</a>

<ol class="org-ol"><li>Xcode Unix Utilities<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-3-1-1-2-1-1">
<p>
On a Mac, at least in 2013, you'll probably want to get your 'hands'
on a piece of software that you may or may not ever use much. X Code
is the massive application that serves developers of programs for any
Apple software. Glossing over some history and nuances, X code will
probably help you take advantage of the "open source core" that has
been at the heart of OS X. 
</p>

<p>
If you don't know much about it, we can for now say that this has to
do with Unix, and leave at that for the moment, until you want to

Another thing that may arise will be the question of how to
contribute to these projects. One of the great things about free
software is that it is not just free as in beer, as the saying goes
[see FSF]. You can modify it in whatever way you want, provided you
know how. And this is no small catch. 
</p>

<p>
Part of the idea behind this document is to make it possible for
non-programmers to eventually be able to figure out how to contribute
to the causes represented by these various programs. But in the
meantime, going from artist to C++ programmer just does not happen
overnight. The path from one to the other remains worth marking out. 
</p>

<p>
The odds are you'll just want to jump in to learning what's possible
in some particular application. For good reasons, this is a way to
go, and may eventually inspire you to want to know more about what's
possible with the given piece of software.

<p>
Nominally just a text editor, Emacs is perhaps the original free software package, still actively
developed and maintained now since the mid-70s. To understand the
staying power of something seemingly as uninteresting as a text editor
may require some context and history. This history is very much bound
up in the trajectory of the free software movement (see more).
</p>

<p>
Since it was actually designed to be a kind of complete operating
system environment, it is not uncommon to hear complaints by diehard
users of having to "leave" Emacs to work in applications. 
</p>

<p>
It is primarily used now as a highly-configurable environment for developing programs
in a huge variety of languages, especially by those who have fully
adopted the Linux operating system. 
</p>

<p>
Ignoring the hyperbole of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_wars">"editor wars,"</a> it's fair to say that the
debate of, essentially, what to type in when navigating around your
computer has given rise to factions and strife. I can say that,
despite its frustrations and learning curve, I am very glad for
having taken approximately 2 years to get the point of understanding
those who don't want to leave emacs.
</p>

Like many of the tools related to programming and text here, emacs is
most likely already installed in some form on your computer. I got
started using it on a Mac, with an implementation, Aquamacs, that makes
for a simplified learning experience for Mac users.

<a href="http://www.latex-project.org">http://www.latex-project.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Built on top of another one of the longstanding free
software projects, LaTeX (nothing to do with the gloves&#x2013;it's
connected to the Greek word "techne") is a program for typesetting
documents. Huh? 
</p>

<p>
The purpose of typesetting at a computer may strike most casual computer
users as odd. This is because we tend to take for granted the reality
that the acronym "WYSIWYG" represents: "what you see is what you
get." That is, when typing a document using a program like Microsoft
Word, what you see on the screen is what pretty much exactly what
your document is going to look like. 
</p>

<p>
That a need for something else exists may only become apparent when
you can't get your document to look quite the way you want. This is
where TeX comes in, as you essentially "program a document:" working
with a text editor, you give TeX some commands along with your
text that will allow you greater control of precisely how you want your
document to look. The final document is produced after processing all
of your commands.
</p>

<p>
If you ever start to really care what your documents look like,
especially if, god forbid, some mathematical text is involved, you'll
see the need for LaTeX, which is ubiquitous in academia. 
</p>

<p>
If you have ever downloaded an article that looked like <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/Publications/isea-reprint.pdf">Miller Puckette's</a> then TeX was probably involved somewhere.

The Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) is designed to get you started
exploring the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

One of the best things about NLTK is that there is an excellent book
freely available (NLP with NLTK) that makes it possible to find out,
say, in what senses Jane Austen uses the word "monstrous" in Sense
and Sensibility (you'd be surprised).
</p>

<p>
NLTK is a great example of newer open source project with a
well-supported code base, and some of the best documentation going (a
whole textbook, published by O'Reilly). Since it is hosted on Github
you can also begin to get familiar with that repository. And most
important of all, it can be an easy way to start to learn how to
program in Python, without having to do a bunch of boring and
meaningless exercises (which appear to be all too necessary parts of
introductory programming texts).
</p>

<p>
[link] 
</p>

<p>
How can I install NLTK from the source code repository?  Most users
should install NLTK from a distribution. Please see the installation
instructions. However, if you need an up-to-the-minute version, then
you will have to install NLTK from the source repository. Once you've
downloaded this, you'll need to run the top level setup.py program to
install this version of NLTK on your machine.

<p>
This may be an odd term for you, but hopefully you have at least
heard of Linux. The word 'ecosystem' usually strikes me as a bit
dubious when applied willy-nilly to any kind of software environment,
but it really is applicable to the Linux, or GNU/Linux world. 
</p>

<p>
Skimming around the various other sections and coming back here will
probably be best, unless you are already especially motivated to
start using the Linux operating system. If you already are working on
a Mac, it is not terribly difficult to actually support both
operating systems, if you want a way to learn incrementally. [link]
</p>

<p>
However, if you are not totally comfortable working at the commandline
[link] you may want instead to start by getting used to that first,
by say doing some exercises, reading some tutorials, and maybe
learning to use a text editor, such as Emacs. It's a process, but one
that will eventually lead to you getting a better understanding of
your computer, and the real value (and challenges) of working with
open source software. [link]

<li>Python<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-3-2-3-2-2-3">
<p>
Python is one of the more popular programming languages, and happens
to be open source, as well. What that means when it comes to a
programming language may be a little unclear, which is ok for the
moment. If you are on a Mac, you most likely already "have"
Python. 
</p>

<p>
Using it with a dedicated "interpreter" [link] is probably best when
starting out, in which case you will want to download IDLE.
</p>

<p>
Here are some further (loosely organized) links to things dealing
with Python.

<li>what is "interpreted?"<br/><div class="outline-text-8" id="text-3-2-3-2-2-3-2">
<p>
Python is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled one,
though the distinction can be blurry because of the presence of the
bytecode compiler. This means that source files can be run directly
without explicitly creating an executable which is then
run. Interpreted languages typically have a shorter development/debug
cycle than compiled ones, though their programs generally also run
more slowly. See also interactive.

<li>Clozure Common Lisp<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-3-2-3-2-2-4">
<p>
One of the oldest (and still relevant) computer languages is
Lisp. Common Lisp is pretty much the standard version of the language
these days, and Clozure is just one of the widely available open
source implementations [link]. 
</p>

<p>
Lisp has been around long enough that its fortunes have risen and
fallen with those of various corners of the computing world. For our
purposes, its importance can be gauged by its influence on Emacs
(which is written in its own version of Lisp. Knowing Lisp allows you
to make virtually any modification and extension to the program you
want). Additionally, for musicians, PWGL makes possible getting into
Lisp programming in a musical setting akin to Max/MSP and Pd. 
</p>

<p>
Please see some of the essays and authors below for more context and
history behind using Lisp. [link]

programming in Common Lisp much more feasible.

At some point, you will discover that somebody has written some kind of
extension to a program that you already use, and you'd like to try
out this extension. But if they are not company, even if they are a
community and not a single person, they need to make this code
available, and not just to people who want to use the extension they've
created. The great innovation of free software projects is that they
take advantage of a community's ability to discover problems and
develop emendations in a way that's impossible for individuals. Is it
better for these teams or informal communities to take responsibility
for this process or for a company of paid individuals? Good luck
sorting that one out [link]

There can be a lot to learn when trying to get comfortable and get
done what you need to get done with software. Some meditations on
cognition, mindfulness and problem-solving can be helpful, if only to
distract you from your problem long enough to figure it out
subconsciously. 
</p>

<p>
Some advice and ideas to think about:
</p>

<p>
Rather than reading something in isolation when we are learning a new
language or technique, we can take advantage of the immediate feedback
that working with an interactive environment provides. Since the
tutorials that are available often just skim the surface of what we're
really interested in, you may find that you get an idea about what
you'd really like to be able to do. this could either be the beginning
of brilliant idea and concrete learned outcome (as they might say in
an educational psychology classroom) or it might be a frustrating
digression through countless vaguely inspiring but ultimately
unhelpful online forums and help pages, since the needed technique
hasn't exactly been mentioned yet. 
</p>

<p>
Be a good steward of your time and know when to back-off the more
ambitious idea. You'll figure it out eventually. Better to get back
to the more narrow path you were being led down by the tutorial.

is an approach to learning that we are usually not taught that may be
helpful. Thinking about thinking, metacognition, is a good way to get

advantageous. But the free availablity of information has its own
charm, (and more importantly, in many cases, moral weight).

<p>
configure; make; make install
</p>

<p>
Submitted by Willy on Saturday, November 22, 2003 - 12:55
</p>

<p>
Over and over I have heard people say that you just use the usual configure, make, make install sequence to get a program running. Unfortunately, most people using computers today have never used a compiler or written a line of program code. With the advent of graphical user interfaces and applications builders, there are lots of serious programmers who have never done this.
</p>

<p>
What you have are three steps, each of which will use a whole host of programs to get a new program up and running. Running configure is relatively new compared with the use of make. But, each step has a very distinct purpose. I am going to explain the second and third steps first, then come back to configure.
</p>

<p>
The make utility is embedded in UNIX history. It is designed to decrease a programmer's need to remember things. I guess that is actually the nice way of saying it decreases a programmer's need to document. In any case, the idea is that if you establish a set of rules to create a program in a format make understands, you don't have to remember them again.
</p>

<p>
To make this even easier, the make utility has a set of built-in rules so you only need to tell it what new things it needs to know to build your particular utility. For example, if you typed in make love, make would first look for some new rules from you. If you didn't supply it any then it would look at its built-in rules. One of those built-in rules tells make that it can run the linker (ld) on a program name ending in .o to produce the executable program.
</p>

<p>
So, make would look for a file named love.o. But, it wouldn't stop there. Even if it found the .o file, it has some other rules that tell it to make sure the .o file is up to date. In other words, newer than the source program. The most common source program on Linux systems is written in C and its file name ends in .c.
</p>

<p>
If make finds the .c file (love.c in our example) as well as the .o file, it would check their timestamps to make sure the .o was newer. If it was not newer or did not exist, it would use another built-in rule to build a new .o from the .c (using the C compiler). This same type of situation exists for other programming languages. The end result, in any case, is that when make is done, assuming it can find the right pieces, the executable program will be built and up to date.
</p>

<p>
The old UNIX joke, by the way, is what early versions of make said when it could not find the necessary files. In the example above, if there was no love.o, love.c or any other source format, the program would have said:
make: don't know how to make love. Stop.
</p>

<p>
Getting back to the task at hand, the default file for additional rules in Makefile in the current directory. If you have some source files for a program and there is a Makefile file there, take a look. It is just text. The lines that have a word followed by a colon are targets. That is, these are words you can type following the make command name to do various things. If you just type make with no target, the first target will be executed.
</p>

<p>
What you will likely see at the beginning of most Makefile files are what look like some assignment statements. That is, lines with a couple of fields with an equal sign between them. Surprise, that is what they are. They set internal variables in make. Common things to set are the location of the C compiler (yes, there is a default), version numbers of the program and such.
</p>

<p>
This now beings up back to configure. On different systems, the C compiler might be in a different place, you might be using ZSH instead of BASH as your shell, the program might need to know your host name, it might use a dbm library and need to know if the system had gdbm or ndbm and a whole bunch of other things. You used to do this configuring by editing Makefile. Another pain for the programmer and it also meant that any time you wanted to install software on a new system you needed to do a complete inventory of what was where.
</p>

<p>
As more and more software became available and more and more POSIX-compliant platforms appeared, this got harder and harder. This is where configure comes in. It is a shell script (generally written by GNU Autoconf) that goes up and looks for software and even tries various things to see what works. It then takes its instructions from Makefile.in and builds Makefile (and possibly some other files) that work on the current system.
</p>

<p>
Background work done, let me put the pieces together.
</p>

<p>
You run configure (you usually have to type ./configure as most people don't have the current directory in their search path). This builds a new Makefile.
Type make This builds the program. That is, make would be executed, it would look for the first target in Makefile and do what the instructions said. The expected end result would be to build an executable program.
Now, as root, type make install. This again invokes make, make finds the target install in Makefile and files the directions to install the program.
This is a very simplified explanation but, in most cases, this is what
you need to know. With most programs, there will be a file named
INSTALL that contains installation instructions that will fill you in
on other considerations. For example, it is common to supply some
options to the configure command to change the final location of the
executable program. There are also other make targets such as clean
that remove unneeded files after an install and, in some cases test
which allows you to test the software between the make and make
install steps.

&gt;&gt; Understanding software Installation (configure, make, make install)
</p>

<p>
This tutorial is aimed at those who have just started using Linux. Generally when users from the Windows background enter the Linux scene,they are totally stumped by the software installation method. They were used to the luxury of double clicking on a single file and getting their software installed. But now they have to type cryptic commands to do the same.
</p>

<p>
Though the installation instructions tell them what to do, they have no idea what those steps actually do. This article shall explain the basics of software installation. After reading this article you would feel more at home when installing your next software.
</p>

<p>
Generally beginners tend to search desperately for RPMs since installing RPMs is a real simple task. But this article doesn't talk about RPMs. It deals with the softwares that you generally get in the zipped formats as tarballs.
</p>


<p>
Details :
</p>

<p>
Generally you would get Linux software in the tarball format (.tgz) This file has to be uncompressed into any directory using tar command. In case you download a new tarball by the name game.tgz, then you would have to type the following command
</p>

<p>
$ tar xfvz game.tgz
</p>

<p>
This would create a directory within the current directory and unzip all the files within that new directory. Once this is complete the installation instructions ask you to execute the 3 (now famous) commands : configure, make &amp; make install. Most of the users do this and successfully install their softwares. But most of the newbies have no idea what this really does. The rest of the article shall explain the meaning of these 3 commands
</p>

<p>
Each software comes with a few files which are solely for the purpose of installation sake. One of them is the configure script. The user has to run the following command at the prompt
</p>

<p>
$ ./configure
</p>

<p>
The above command makes the shell run the script named ' configure ' which exists in the current directory. The configure script basically consists of many lines which are used to check some details about the machine on which the software is going to be installed. This script checks for lots of dependencies on your system. For the particular software to work properly, it may be requiring a lot of things to be existing on your machine already. When you run the configure script you would see a lot of output on the screen , each being some sort of question and a respective yes/no as the reply. If any of the major requirements are missing on your system, the configure script would exit and you cannot proceed with the installation, until you get those required things. 
</p>

<p>
The main job of the configure script is to create a ' Makefile ' . This is a very important file for the installation process. Depending on the results of the tests (checks) that the configure script performed it would write down the various steps that need to be taken (while compiling the software) in the file named Makefile.
</p>

<p>
If you get no errors and the configure script runs successfully (if there is any error the last few lines of the output would glaringly be stating the error) then you can proceed with the next command which is
</p>

<p>
$ make
</p>

<p>
' make ' is actually a utility which exists on almost all Unix systems. For make utility to work it requires a file named Makefile in the same directory in which you run make. As we have seen the configure script's main job was to create a file named Makefile to be used with make utility. (Sometimes the Makefile is named as makefile also)
</p>

<p>
make would use the directions present in the Makefile and proceed with the installation. The Makefile indicates the sequence, that Linux must follow to build various components / sub-programs of your software. The sequence depends on the way the software is designed as well as many other factors.
</p>

<p>
The Makefile actually has a lot of labels (sort of names for different sections). Hence depending on what needs to be done the control would be passed to the different sections within the Makefile Or it is possible that at the end of one of the section there is a command to go to some next section.
</p>

<p>
Basically the make utility compiles all your program code and creates the executables. For particular section of the program to complete might require some other part of the code already ready, this is what the Makefile does. It sets the sequence for the events so that your program does not complain about missing dependencies.
</p>

<p>
One of the labels present in the Makefile happens to be named ' install ' .
</p>

<p>
If make ran successfully then you are almost done with the installation. Only the last step remains which is
</p>

<p>
$ make install
</p>

<p>
As indicated before make uses the file named Makefile in the same directory. When you run make without any parameters, the instruction in the Makefile begin executing from the start and as per the rules defined within the Makefile (particular sections of the code may execute after one another..thats why labels are used..to jump from one section to another). But when you run make with install as the parameter, the make utility searches for a label named install within the Makefile, and executes only that section of the Makefile.
</p>

<p>
The install section happens to be only a part where the executables and other required files created during the last step (i.e. make) are copied into the required final directories on your machine. E.g. the executable that the user runs may be copied to the /usr/local/bin so that all users are able to run the software. Similarly all the other files are also copied to the standard directories in Linux. Remember that when you ran make, all the executables were created in the temporary directory where you had unzipped your original tarball. So when you run make install, these executables are copied to the final directories.
</p>

<p>
Thats it !! Now the installation process must be clear to you. You surely will feel more at home when you begin your next software installation.

taken straight from this blog entry
<a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/27-fundamental-qualities-of-good-programmers">https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/27-fundamental-qualities-of-good-programmers</a>
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol"><li>Knowing one programming language really well<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-1">
<p>
Programming languages are just tools for telling computers what to do. It is better to have a strong command of one than a weak command of a bunch. Good programmers have at least one language that they know inside and out and can reach for to easily solve whatever problem is at hand.1
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Being a systematic debugger<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-2">
<p>
Being a systematic debugger means that you have a good mental model of your code and that when you run into a bug—that is, when your program doesn't work as expected—you generate hypotheses about what's wrong, instead of blindly changing things until your program works.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Having a good mental model of your programming environment<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-3">
<p>
Most programs interact with the outside world, so having an understanding of your environment is important. This includes the I/O and concurrency primitives that your language provides, the way your language finds, loads, compiles, and runs code, the way that your program gets info from the outside world (e.g., environmental variables and command line arguments), and the way your OS handles file access, device access, search paths, etc.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Having a good mental model of the hardware you use<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-4">
<p>
Knowing how your hardware works makes it easier to write efficient programs. Even if you are writing programs in a higher level language, understanding things like the call stack, the MMU, the cost of context switching, the memory hierarchy, and the characteristics of the network you are connected to will inform your programming decisions.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Being comfortable with algorithmic thinking<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-5">
<p>
A lot of people confuse algorithmic thinking with knowing a bunch of particular algorithms like quicksort or binary search.
</p>

<p>
An algorithm is a set of steps describing a calculation. Much of programming is simply describing algorithms to a computer. Being comfortable with algorithmic thinking means having good intuition for how to store and manipulate your data, being able to think both iteratively and recursively, and being able to reason about the performance characteristics of the code you write.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Being comfortable with mathematical thinking<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-6">
<p>
Programming is not as math-heavy as many non-programmers think, but as you start tackling tougher problems, you'll find that being comfortable with math comes in handy. Many interesting areas of programming like computer graphics, signal processing, and cryptography require a deep understanding of math. Even just measuring the performance of your code can require some statistical thinking.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Being able to write a program from scratch<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-7">
<p>
It is hard to imagine a good programmer who cannot write a program from scratch.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Being able to work on a small piece of a large program<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-8">
<p>
Most of the time you're not writing a program from scratch. Instead, you're working with other programmers on a large project.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Knowing how to structure your code<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-9">
<p>
Well-structured code allows you to easily navigate up and down through layers of abstraction. In a well-structured program, you can ignore implementation details when they don't matter and modify the implementation without having to make changes in all the places where the code is used.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Having a large code radius<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-10">
<p>
Code radius is a term that Alan came up with. Your code radius is the size of the largest program you're comfortable writing from scratch. Increasing your code radius takes practice. The structural tools that work well for a 500 line program are not necessarily the same as the ones that work for a 5,000 line program or a 50,000 line program.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Being able to code quickly<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-11">
<p>
Often times it's faster to try out a few different solutions and decide which is the most elegant than to figure out the correct one just by thinking about it. If you find "quickly" to be too subjective, consider the inverse: It's hard to imagine a good programmer who is slow.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Being productive with your tools<br/><div class="outline-text-7" id="text-4-2-1-6-1-12">
<p>
Good programmers use their tools effectively. This doesn't mean you have to use all the tools available to you in order to be a good programmer—not everyone likes IDEs and plenty of good programmers prefer printf to a debugger—just that good programmers are productive with the tools they choose to use.

file endings mean. And that means you are in a good position to

In this document I have generally tried to abide by a convention of
using both the terms "free software" and "open source." (My rule of
thumb is to prefer "free" in front of the word "software" and "open
source" in front of other nouns, like "world" or "model," thus trying
to emphasize that "free" designates software with "limited
restrictions," rather "than provided at no cost").

when speaking informally, but don't let <a href="#sec-5-1-2">Richard Stallman</a> hear you.

Questions from an economic perspective about the role of FLOSS are
worth considering, especially for how they either align or diverge
from the more radical model imagined by Stallman. Though this seemingly takes
us rather far afield from art-making, its relevance to the ways we get
our art-related softwar should be apparent.

Since the internet can make possible both breadth and depth of
research in a way like no other, there may end up being a quite a
number of links to many disparate things. One small goal, however, is
to avoid simply accumulating of links, especially to that rich and
dangerous pandora's box that is wikipedia. It is of course as good a
place as any to quickly find out what something is. But we are hoping
here to make use of a tailored approach. Wherever possible, some
editorial shaping of content that may be helpful to a media student
is to be preferred over a "link dump," (which nevertheless may be
inevitable at first, especially in the philosophy or finding out more
sections), until more "curated content" can be provided.
</p>

<p>
Particularly, it can be very easy to simply click links and skim
webpages, leaving a trail of open tabs overflowing one's
webbrowser. Isn't it better to deeply engage with one or two really
helpful sources, rather than know about the endless proliferation of
sites that may or may not be helpful? As such, we strive to, as much
as possible, share a link to something based on an a positive or edifying
experience with that thing. 
</p>

<p>
So, for example, if you think of a topic and a link that you think
might be relevant, try to say what you know about it or why it might
useful in as pithy a way as possible. If any kind of neutrality is
going to be hard, consider creating a link to a personal page where
you can expand on your idea, and let your enthusiasm pour forth.

while the focus in this document is on things that might bear on an
artist's ability to make sense of the world of open source software,
it seems reasonable to collect some things that are maybe just off to
the side of that focus. Where and how to incorporate such information
remains a question, if "feature creep" and info-bloat is to be
avoided. With that in mind, I propose thinking about this whole
section as a kind of Appendix, where such miscellanies that pertain
more exclusively to artists and digital art-making in the PIMA,
Brooklyn College community can have an healthy, unobtrusive home.
</p>

<p>
One easy thing to do is to provide some resources to find out more
about existing work at the intersection of art and
technology.
