until the 90s and music editing software. Exploded my brain (2008),
took over my life (2011), led to my first computing gig (2013).

<p>
The most crucial juncture is the point at which it went from being
fun, to alienating and disturbing, to liberating and
reinvigoratin. Miller Puckette's work, Pd, and the community around
it, as exemplfied by Pd-extended, were critical. I'll describe a few

let me start&#x2026;not so much autobiographically, but in taking myself
to be a kind of case study. With a brief description of what I
wanted to do, what I have found myself doing, and what I feel like
I have learned. Such a personal approach has its drawbacks, of
course: what do you care what I did? and how could it even help
you, when what you want to do is not what I did? and just who the
hell do I think I am? Some explanation is in order, if nothing else,
to gain the sympathy of the dubious reader.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
in many ways, what you are reading is a reflection of my personal
interests and actitivies during my time in PIMA ("Everything I Really Needed to Know I Read in a Tutorial
at PIMA").
</p>

<p>
There are a great many virtues to working independently through
tutorials (at least for some people), but there will also be a great many hours spent
looking for the relevant information, or trying to figure out what
the relevant information even means.
</p>

<p>
But here's an example problematic scenario. In order to use
software X, you have to have software Y. But in order to get
software Y, you have to know how to use some software Z that is
easy to find but hard to use to get software Y unless you already
know to use it. Thus, to get software X to do the awesome thing
you just thought of in an inspired vision, you have to jump
through several hoops that are nowhere near as beautiful or
exciting as the great idea you just had and are already
forgetting.
</p>

<p>
If this doesn't sound familiar, my guess is one of two things is
likely: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>either you don't need to ever read this because you have

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Whatever the case, one idea here is simply to talk about some
pieces of software that you may or may not have come across, but
which I have found useful, or interesting, largely during my time
as a peculiar student in the MFA program at Brooklyn College's Performance and
Interactive Media Art. 
</p>

<p>
As a musician, my
experience has been most extensive with audio applications&#x2013;but
a larger thesis, which I can only hint at here, is that the information that I have (or you may)
acquired working through the software related to your medium can
form an entry, if not a foundation, for doing ANYTHING. Moreover, if
you are patient enough to learn how to use some new technology,
than I warrant that you have a skill that could be useful beyond
the scope of whatever your immediate goal was. You could learn to
do some things that may be even more useful (in a world that
hasn't yet created a home for your peculiar artistic idea, activity
artifact or intellectual construct! Sound enticing? Here are links
to some specifics.

<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> the purpose of a (this?) tutorial</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2013-11-06 Wed 17:55]</span></span>
From what I've gathered, in my patient saga of autodidacticism, the
ostensible purpose of a tutorial is not to show one person how to do
one thing, but to cast as wide a net as possible. Not to unwittingly
continue the metaphor, but the old saw of "teach a man to fish&#x2026;"
seems relevant: you need to show someone how to do things that will
ultimately help them do WHATEVER they want at some point in the
hopefully not too far off future. Since this can be hard to do,
there's a temptation in writing a tutorial to instead simply do the
fishing for the reader&#x2013;to show them exactly what you did, so they can
do that one thing. Which may seem rather myopic and entirely too much
like simply giving a man a fish.
</p>

<p>
But here's where the metaphor breaks down, and must unremorsefully
be abandoned. Imitation&#x2013;walking yourself through the steps that
somebody else went through&#x2013;is actually one of the best ways to
start out. As acute observers of human behavior will note,
following comes quite naturally to us humans; we excel at watching
and borrowing. And in an autodidactic situation, it is a skill that
has much to recommend it. You do not have to give birth, fully
formed, to your own mental plan of how to carry out exactly what
you want to do, but can instead look at how to modify or deviate
from one model that at least has the virtue of having already
succeeded at some point. To venture one more perhaps strained
analogy, it's like the difference between giving somebody a book on
how to get rich versus actually giving somebody a job; sure, they
might appreciate the fact that you want them to ultimately succeed
at the highest level, but there are a whole lot more immediate
concerns. A vast capital empire begins with a single commodity
exchange&#x2026;thus, bringing to an end my string of strained analogies
and paraphrases of adages.

<h3 id="sec-1-6"><span class="section-number-3">1.6</span> initial encounters with the "free vs. open" theme</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
I have historically been a musician, primarily. But I began this
project out of a sense of having spent a great deal of time over
the last two years not playing music: instead, I was poking around
my computer and any tutorials I could find, desperately trying to
understand how to do <span class="underline">something</span>. And as a <span class="underline">freelance</span> musician,
this something typically involved using free software&#x2013;or better
yet, trying to LEARN how to get, install and use free software. Why
"free?" Well, it turns out that a simple question like this has a
long history. And the possible responses have more than enough
complications to take us largely beyond the scope of this writing,
which is about how to find your way around the free software world,
not "why" you might need to do that in the first place. I'll
address the 'free' issue soon enough.

<h3 id="sec-1-7"><span class="section-number-3">1.7</span> breaking with tutorial style and etiquette</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p>
To any experienced reader of software tutorials, the sheer length
at which I have gone on in what is just a preface will may mark
this writing as being NOT FOR THEM. That may be entirely true. The
raison d'etre, if you will, for this tutorial is to make it easier
for anybody who is not used to sitting down to a highly compressed,
gnomic explanation of the specifications of some perhaps highly
abstract bit of technical knowhow. David Foster Wallace has pointed
out an irony of guides to English usage: that the people who need
them the most are not the people most likely to buy them. Something
similar can be said about software tutorials: the people most
likely to be well-versed enough to actually write one are perhaps
the least likely to be helpful. Since they have already progressed
so far from the initial stages that their readers will be starting
from, they may not necessarily be well-suited for the
characterisitc most required for good instruction: empathy. And
we're not talking just any kind of empathy here. We're talking
about an ability to finely calibrate one's demeanor and explanatory
style to fit the needs of the individual. Considering that this
ability must also come with a commmand of the more abstract aspects
of the subject matter and the problem emerges quite clearly. At the
risk of invoking an all-too-vague and frequently unhelpful word,
the intelligences that are required are emotional as well as verbal
or logical. And I don't know about you, but I've noticed that there
are no rules for how these things are apportioned among people, or
within even a given person.

<h3 id="sec-1-8"><span class="section-number-3">1.8</span> the artist's voice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p>
Much of this prefacing could be summed by saying that this is a
tutorial, which sometimes digresses on technical matters, BY an
artist and FOR artists. I thus make as few assumptions as possible
about how much you, as an artist, already know about the matters at
hand. I do assume, however, that like myself, you have as much of
the qualities that make for a great humanist as great
technician. That is, that you were as likely to have been trained
in a "human" art form as a "technical" one.

<p>
there is no shortage of books for teaching yourself "x." In fact,
there's even something called "Learn X the Hard Way," which is
mostly about learning to program in some computer language X of
your choice.
</p>

<p>
There are several differences here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>This is not about learning to program in a specific language,
per se.
</li>

<li>This is written for artists by an artist, with input from
other artists.

</p>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It assumes that artists are intelligent, sensitive, and extremely
well-versed in some particular domain, one that may even
involve extensive use of a computer.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Perhaps most significantly,
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It assumes that artists are not used to thinking about or
using the concept of "data" in their day-to-day work.
</li>
</ol>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-9-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.9.1</span> data-driven</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-1">
<p>
The emphasis on data placed here is significant because, unlike
humans, computers are not good at intuiting what we mean, or
what we might be thinking. You could argue that nor are all
humans, but at least we have evolved to be at least capable of
such intuitions. Computers, or at least the ones artists are
likely to avail themselves of in the era of this writing, are
designed not to be human-like at inferring what we mean, but to
be good at dealing with data. 
</p>

<p>
This is, of course, purposefully vague. Because part of the point
about data is that the concept is stripped of nearly all
detail&#x2013;the word in Latin simply refers to that which is
given. Which is being pretty vague, indeed. 
</p>

<p>
While all humans may be slightly perplexed by this concept&#x2013;
data&#x2013;artists may be more likely to not just be befuddled or
nonplussed but downright vexed or resentful! To begin with, data
is a plural word that often feels like it should be singular, so
we already get off to a bad start once we have to talk about what
data is&#x2026;I mean, "are." Furthermore, data typically is/are what
you enter when you get your first entry-level temp job; data
is/are what you plot on a graph in math class. Data is banking,
and statistics, and scientific method, and everything seemingly
inimical to what English Romantic poets like Blake and Wordsworth
brought to consciousness hundreds of years of ago. 
</p>

<p>
At least, this thought can't help but surface if you have spent
much time thinking about that time period in Western art and
literature. This condition is increasingly less easy to take for
granted in 2013, which suggests that the themes such artists were
concerned with are less relevant now. The validity of the above
reasoning is not under discussion here, though. My purpose is
simply to state baldly that it is hard to imagine an adolescent
version of myself putting down my copy of Intimations of
Immortality in order to pick up and begin reading "How to think
like a computer scientist." Maybe that's just me. But
from what I have gathered about artists, or those with
artistic temperaments, thinking about the world&#x2013;to say nothing of
their own passions&#x2013;as somehow reducible to data is odd, or worse.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-9-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.9.2</span> it's ok</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-2">
<p>
This, however, is evidently not the place to reconcile these ways
of looking at the world. Let it simply be known that it's primary
author was familiar with Heidegger's deeply skeptical, "The
Question Concerning Technology" long before he ever knew what a
command-line interface was. I hope that somehow that fact plays a
part in my humble attempt to help artists learn how to learn how
to install and run software. The circularity there is part of the
pleasure of having put down Wordsworth for some time now, in the
interest of learning something new.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-9-3"><span class="section-number-4">1.9.3</span> a question of audience</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-3">
<p>
one problem we sometimes face in life is appropriately tailoring our
communication to a particular audience. In some cases, it is an
audience that shares much of the same knowledge&#x2013;for whatever
reason, the speaker and the audience have a common context within
which they can communicate, sometimes using shorthand
expressions, or relying on assumptions that derive from similar
experiences between people who otherwise may have little in common.
</p>

<p>
This fairly describes many groups, but the techie world is
especially known for often seeming impenterable to
newcomers. This can be the case for people happen to just occupy
different spheres of the tech world; programmers who work in one
language or kind of technology can become very insular (look up
"the editor wars" for an example). 
</p>

<p>
People who are just developing their understanding of a
technology can take heart from this fact&#x2013;that what can seem like
a peculiar in-language may still seem like that to people who are
otherwise well-versed in other some particular branch of
technology.
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem, then, lies in how to begin developing that
context for oneself. And for this there are few shortcuts. In
fact, the initial discomfort and vexation that comes with
learning a new vocabulary or new way of working can be such that
it quite quickly and permanently dissuades viable canditates for
learning from persisting long enough to see any fruits from their
efforts.
</p>

<p>
So let's think about what's required for the process of acquiring
enough context for the language in a tutorial, or even at higher
conceptual level, a way of thinking or working through a kind of
system to seem helpful.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-9-4"><span class="section-number-4">1.9.4</span> learning</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-9-4">
<p>
One of the keys to confronting material that is in a strange
"language" is to read and re-read. Doing so without breaks in
between can, however, prove more frustrating than
anything. Speculating on just why, I have always thought of a
concept I read about in cognitive science: consolidating. This is
sometimes used to refer to the process with the brain uses to
acquire and retain memories. 
</p>

<p>
This is not the place to go deeper into the mechanism by which
this works, except to say that it appears to be connected to the
way the brain processes at sub- or unconscious levels. A common
experience is to have a name or thought "on the tip of my tongue"
and yet, as long as one continues to "TRY" to remember the brain
does not return the desired information.  It is only when one
stops consciously TRYING to recall and instead moves on to
another processing task that the missing word "pops up"
miraculously. 
</p>

<p>
Now, this should not be thought of as "consolidation" in
action. Rather, it is a easy-to-relate-to example of brain
functioning made nearly tangible. Learning anything new of
sufficient strangeness or complexity involves both conscious and
unconscious processes. Which is why perhaps the most important
trait for helping oneself through the process is patience. Words
like sedulous, tenacious, diligent, perserverance, resilient&#x2013;all
should give us a sense of what we can strive for. The feeling of
frustration&#x2013;of not getting it, even after repeated, persistent
effort&#x2013;is often sufficient to stymie a learner, and bring to a
peremptory end "the learning process."
</p>

<p>
So tuning in to the extremely small pleasures available to the
sensitive learner, deriving some sense of satisifaction&#x2013;however
minor&#x2013;from one's persistence is key. One of the best one's for
me has always been just an increased sense of familiarity. This
can be a perfectly adequate, if temporary, substitute for
comprehension. Simply recognizing the material one was struggling
to process the day before can be thought of as a kind of
progress.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-10">
<p>
for those of us who driven cars for any period of time, there are
some hoary analogies lurking here, specifically that of the
so-called "black box." This refers to any system the details of
which have been hidden away from the typical user. And the
typical user is typically content not knowing how a sparkplug
works. Until something goes wrong. At which point, a range of
possibilities present themselves, though you have to imagine a
vast majority of us only see one: take the car to somebody who
in fact knows how a sparkplug works. And more importantly, knows
how to remove, replace and install one&#x2013;delving into the black
box that we treat as an abstract unit: the engine.
</p>

<p>
There are a great many advantages to this system, which
potentially make it not the most auspicious analogy for someone
who wants to talk about the value of learning how software works.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-11">
<p>
The fact remains&#x2013;most of us come to learn how to use computers by
interacting with graphic interfaces. That is, for many of us, the
most frequent experience we've had with computers has been based on
many other things beside pure text. In fact, seeing anything on a
computer screen which is primarily just text&#x2013;no images, drop-down
menus or places to click&#x2013;can be strange at first, or even
intimidating. 
</p>

<p>
It would, of course, be difficult to overestimate the effect that
"user-friendly" visual design has had on the popularity of personal
computing. Of course, what exactly constitutes 'friendly' varies
widely, depending on the person and the comfort level. Whatever your
personal predilections, the argument for developing text-based,
command line skills becomes increasingly persuasive as you want to do
have more control over what you can do. And as you spend more time
working with the things your software currently makes possible, the
more you may realize that you are developing a way of a working, a
personal computing style, in which you wish you could just do
X. Since with computers it's mostly a matter of knowing how to "tell"
your computer what you want it do, you will eventually need to learn
what kind of 'language' your computer understands (whatever the
deficiencies of this language, you can be assured it will not blush or bat
an eye at the torrent of vulgarities you direct at it when
frustrated). 
</p>

<p>
One effect of relying on software which lacks
limitations on how you can modify it is that&#x2013;tada, you may be
EXPECTED to modify it!
</p>

<p>
All the ramifications of this fact may not be obvious at the moment,
except to say that modifying how something works usually requires some
UNDERSTANDING of <span class="underline">how</span> it works. And this is one of the hidden topics
of this writing: how do we gain <span class="underline">understanding</span>, of anything
from software to the meaning of a word?
</p>

<p>
While this is necessarily a rather broad question, one way to
think about it at a relatively high level while keeping in mind the practical
imperatives of using software effectively is to develop one's
understanding of HOW software&#x2013;any software&#x2013;works. Now, this is an
enormous topic, but one way to simplify it is to point out that
software is typically made by people. It is WRITTEN; it is CREATED;
it is BUILT; it is DESIGNED. 
</p>

<p>
The emphasis here is to show that there is a process not dissimilar
to the ones artists and "non-computer people" have been using
throughout history&#x2013;fabrication, for lack of less-loaded word. And if
it is <span class="underline">written</span>, than we might do well to consider the issue of
language, and the fact that, at some basic level, most software is
WRITTEN/CREATED/BUILT/DESIGNED by using a language.
</p>

<p>
Do we need to be experts on Language, or know everything that goes
into using or understanding a language in general? As interesting as
it may be to consider more deeply something all of us are literally
"conversant in," a person setting out to accomplish some small or
large task usually does not begin by considering all the rules and formal
properties that characterize the language required by the task (and
this goes as much for computer-based tasks as for more traditional
tasks).
</p>

<p>
However, we relative neophtyes might find it helpful to gain some
perspective on what we do when trying to use a computer to help us
accomplish our task, to create whatever we have in mind. And this perspective can be gained
very quickly by considering two phrases: machine language and natural
language. 
</p>

<p>
If you are like me, you may have little memory of the process of how
you acquired "language skills." But it almost certain that no one ever
used the phrase "natural language" while you were learning to speak, or
learning to read. And yet now, if we are to take this process of
learning just HOW some piece of software that we want to use works, we
must consider this very name for what we have been using as long as we
can remember. Why? Because the power that computers afford us derives
precisely from the fact that they rely on something very different
from natural language: "machine language."
</p>

<p>
The very phrase "machine language" should convey some impression of
what would be involved in developing a complete understanding of how
computers, and by extension, software works. For now, the best part is that
you do not have to have to learn to speak "machine language" to
undestand what it is, or how to tap into its power, to use software. 
</p>

<p>
However, to use software that requires, or better <span class="underline">affords</span> you,
greater sophistication, we very much need to think about the gap
between these two "languages." One of the key things that bridges
that gap is another strange language: the programming language. 
</p>

<p>
What do you, who desires to use some piece of free software, need to
understand about this third kind of language? It is entirely
dependent on your goals. AND, unfortunately perhaps, on the goals of
the person who WROTE/CREATED/BUILT/DESIGNED the software that you are
interested in using, or at least learning more about.
</p>

<p>
Because at the time of this writing, late 2013, two distinct trends
co-exist in the increasingly technological society you most likely
inhabit. One is caused by this reliance on technology, and
specifically on computers, or better, so-called <span class="underline">personal</span>
computers. As computers continue to proliferate, there seems to be no
shortage of demand for them. Which means that there is more demand
for the software that drives them, and which we know&#x2013;natch&#x2013;is
typically written by people like you and me. This suggests that more
people will be involved in writing this software. 
</p>

<p>
Or maybe not. Maybe it's
just that fewer people will be involved in the kinds of activity
which we called manual labor, but will use computers with the same
understanding of the underlying mechanics of them that the average farmer had of
the internal combustion engine that propelled his tractor (apologies to all
farmers reading this who have more knowledge of the ICE than I am
assuming). This points to the
second trend. 
</p>

<p>
As computers become ever more popular and widespread,
one design philosophy sees to it that they are built to be "easier to use." One
way to think about that is that more control is being built into the
software on computers themselves, so that operating one requires as
little knowledge as possible. One only needs to have seen a toddler
"swipe" a touchscreen to comprehend this trend.
</p>

<p>
So where should we position ourselves with respect to this dichotomy?
Between the options of more intuitive design on the one hand and more well-versed
users on the other? The purpose of this writing is not to take sides, or even
think much about whether it is a legitmate questions at all. We are
simply here to use software that allows us to do whatever we want
with it, provided we have the requisite skills. 
</p>

<p>
And so because these skills in the end do have something to do with
language, like so many forms of our knowledge, it behooves us to
think about the existing means we have for dealing with languages,
and specifically dealing with them on the computer. This may not be
the same thing as learning a programming language (which may or may
not be equivalent to "learning to program"), but it should make it
easier to understand some of what is involved in such languages, at
least as far as getting the most out of free software is concerned. 
</p>

<p>
So let's begin with a simple fact: in that space between machine and
natural language that is the programming language are symbols that look vaguely familiar. Those of us
who spent much time digging into computers or books on computing may
even have come across things like the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-C"><span style="color: #0000ff;">insertion_sort</span>(<span style="color: #228b22;">item</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">s</span>[], <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">n</span>)
{
  <span style="color: #228b22;">int</span> <span style="color: #a0522d;">i</span>, <span style="color: #a0522d;">j</span>; <span style="color: #b22222;">/* </span><span style="color: #b22222;">counters </span><span style="color: #b22222;">*/</span>

  <span style="color: #a020f0;">for</span> (i=1; i&lt;n: i++) {
    j=i;
    <span style="color: #a020f0;">while</span> ((j&gt;0) &amp;&amp; (s[j] &lt; s[j-1])) {
      swap(&amp;s[j],&amp;s[j-1]);
      j = j-1;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Let's state clearly at the outset: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THIS
MEANS IN YOUR LIFE! Just notice for now that it contains familiar words like "for" and
"item." And keep in mind that the person who "wrote" it most likely needed to do
what I am doing right now to accomplish the task: she had to type it on a
keyboard. 
</p>

<p>
PROBABLY OBVIOUS FACT STILL WORTH MENTIONING NOW:
</p>

<p>
A ton of computing revolves around typing "words" on a keyboard! 
</p>

<p>
Why does this matter? Because it should be reassuring that, in all
likelihood, you already know something about this! Let's balance this
reassuring fact out with something potentially less familiar and
reassuring:
</p>

<p>
Perhaps even more computing (in 2013) revolves around using something called a GUI&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Yikes! Things always run smoothly until the first unpronounceable
acronym appears. This one (pronounced "Gooey," as in warm chocolate
chip cookies) stands for Graphical User Interface. What the hell is
that? Well, if you have ever seen a typewriter (perhaps in an old
movie, if not in real life), you can think about everything that's
not the piece of paper or the typewriter itself. 
</p>

<p>
Huh?
</p>

<p>
One of the great revolutions in computing was the appearance of all
the things that made it less like typing and more like&#x2026;something
else entirely. Words that had existed for centuries like "icon,"
"window," "menu," "desktop" (ok, maybe not centuries) all of sudden
were repurposed to refer to new "objects," objects which maybe had
parallels in the "real world" but now appeared to have a new existence
that was solely on the computer screen (the question of "existence" "on"
a computer is tricky on, needless to say). 
</p>

<p>
To avoid digressing into computing history, let's just say that today,
many people may find it difficult to imagine using a computer which lacked
these convenient things. Which thus brings us to one of the most important points so
far. 
</p>

<p>
As was said before, programming languages are our bridge between the familiar world of
natural language&#x2013;which the "more intuitive," "natural" interface (or
GUI) of the modern personal computer serves to flesh out&#x2013;and the
human-unreadable "gibberish" of machine language. While we do not
need to know programming languages to use free software, it doesn't
hurt to learn about them, or the things people do with them. And
here's the another important if not obvious fact: most programming languages are text-based. That
means that while GUI-elements like icons and windows may have been
involved in making the software that you want to use, the
key components the creator/writer had to grapple with were, typically, words and symbols, just like those one might clack
out on a typewriter.
</p>

<p>
Thus, anyone who wants to use more software in a more sophisticated
way, and especially anyone who has ever wanted to change software he
was using in ways that its proprietor did not make readily possible, will
need to become comfortable not just with the images and visual
elements of the GUI,
but with something as old-fashioned as letters and numbers and
obscure symbols like the caret and the asterisk. Not only that, but
such a person will eventually experience the power that a semicolon
can yield, and conversely, the frustration that an improperly placed
semicolon that cause. 
</p>

<p>
All of this has been taking us up to another crucial acronym: the
CLI, which, fittingly, lacks a cute pronounciation. It stands for a
Command-Line Interface. The key difference in interfaces here is between "Command-Line"
and "Graphical User." 
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time, (which this writer can
recall) computers were primarily accessed via something called
"terminals," which, in my case, had one stark user-interface feature: green text on a black background. Now, no
one should expect have to go back and learn what exactly was going on
during that era or what the relationship between a terminal and a
"mainframe" was. But it turns out that, to use open source software,
being comfortable at such a "terminal" interface&#x2013;which we can think
of as a "command-line"&#x2013;is actually quite useful. 
</p>

<p>
Now to all readers for whom the prospect of working with a
command-line interface is notably distressing, let me remind you of
the first big fact mentioned at the beginning: it's all still mostly
words on a keyboard (until it's all just
gestures on a touchscreen!). And so a good amount of what is required to get more
familiar with what goes on "inside" the software we want to use is to
get comfortable with the
underlying words and symbols that make up the menus and options of the GUI
sported by your piece of software of choice. 
</p>

<p>
Good news, again. 
</p>

<p>
Unless one is using a computer solely as a kind of enhanced
television (or as a subtitute game-console, recording studio or
multimedia canvas), the odds are high that you have spent significant
amounts of time typing text that
appeared on a screen. "Word processing," it turns out, is a good preparation for
learning more about what goes on inside your software. 
</p>

<p>
Now, for anybody who ever had an animated paperclip appear on that
screen to inform you of a problem in your writing, or for anybody who
ever had drafted an email which disappeared into the ether, there may
be some "baggage" loading down one's personal associations with "word
processing." Let us then turn our attention away from such a phrase
and think instead about a perhaps less loaded term: "text editing."

<h3 id="sec-1-12"><span class="section-number-3">1.12</span> reflections about reading programming</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-12">
<p>
One of the legimate complaints one might imagine hearing offered up
about the learning to program, orfiguring out something on the
computer, or just about the technological approach in general, is
that it is boring, alienating foregin, unintuive or unnatural
seeming.  It seems wise to acknowledge the legitmacy of tese
reactions rather than simply mount a defense, pure and simple. Would
that there were ways to present the neeed informatoin, to instill the
needed skills and ways fo thinking, ways to induce the kind of
mentality, that did not seem like brainwashing, that idd not require
putting to sleep parts of being that keep us alive, that serve to
make us who we are. We are in fact problem-solvers. We do relfect and
analyze. But we do not immediately apodt new new systems of
symbology. Learning new terms, and more importantly lerning the new
ways those terms are strung together to form significant
meanings&#x2013;none ofeahch of these things presents quite natural
problems, which are infrequently resolved to everyone's
satisfaction.  This may not seem significant, or rather may seem
simply the way it is, as it were. 
</p>

<p>
But if we are to move into a the coming intellectua and culutral age,
it strikes me that we would do well to examine the technological
approach in a new way, one that is sympathetic both to these kind of
plaints, but also to the misgivings about the larger import of the
project that they represent. 
</p>

<p>
Can you learn to program while reading Heidegger's QUestion
Concerning Technology? Is there some way to maintain a poet's
mentality while developing one's understanding of the syntax of
various computer languages? Can one be passionate about data, as an
artist is passionate about color, or chords? It's fair to sy that
each of these thoughts reveals an uneasy tension at the heart of
something like "digital humanities."
</p>

<p>
And yet, if they are to succeed, to remain relevant, they must find
ways to reconcile themselves to conditions which increasingly pervade
our conscioousness, which make up the fabric of the world which we
reflect on and think through artistically.  NOt with a sense of
having lost some battle, of resigning to the harsh technological reality of the
future, but with the desire to be there, shaping it, and particpating
and offering our voices. And gaining something in return. Expaniding
our awareness of the world around us, and possible ways to naviagte
thothrough that world. Becuase ultimately every profession must
implicitly make an argument for its continued survival, and
relevance. Surely there are many reasons why we would want to the
arts to persist, to "endure" and one of the simplest and most
effective ones is that they "help." What do they help us do? 'TO know
ourselves' has been a strong answer for an indeterminate period of
time. 
</p>

<p>
BUt now we can strive to supply another answer, one that can be more
bound up in and congnizant of whatever has been gained amid all the
tears toil and bloodshed of the "modern age." An art hwich only looks
selectively around it, which only sees what has been lost and what
has robbed will ultimately ring hollow, as people fail to identify
with the sense of loss in their continued existence out on the plain
of the future,  in the sanctuary of they make of the now.

<h3 id="sec-1-13"><span class="section-number-3">1.13</span> putting the "source" in open source</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-13">
<p>
One of the things that explains the lengths I am going through here is
that to gain a deeper understanding of open source it helps to be able
to know something about what the "source" refers to exactly. 
</p>

<p>
Understanding 'source' actually entails understanding something of the
underlying instructions that make the programs we want to run do what
we want them to do. This requires developing an understanding of a
computer language, the one that your program is written in. But, as
with learning any language, you'd have to devote a considerable amount
of time and effort to learning, say, Python, well enough to be able
know what the source is "doing."  So, if you just want the effect that
the source provides, you may not ever feel compelled to actually begin
the process of learning the language
