# What is this project about?

This project began as an outline--in org mode (which allows easy
conversion to html)--of a guide for media arts students in
understanding how to find and use free and open source software.

The outline, which is contained as "primary" doc, is quite evidently a
work in progress. What does that mean, exactly, for someone looking to
get something out of it?

## Prolegomena

Well, because it is perhaps overly ambitious (hence the whole quirky
Kant "prolegomena" business), it makes sense to begin thinking about
how having a sense of "the big picture" might help one make sense of
it all. And who is that "one?"

Please see the READMEs of the primary docs and secondary docs,
respectively, in order to begin getting a sense of the scope and more
specific purpose of all this. For now.

### *One* Path
Well, for now, in the secondary docs, the file "Young-ciceros-path" is
the beginnings of an autobiographical explication of one approach to
navigating the arts/programming divide--i.e. one example of one person
(an "artist" for lack of a better term) trying to make sense of this
much-vaunted big picture.
