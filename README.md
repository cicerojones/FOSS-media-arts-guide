Outline--in org mode, which can be converted to html--of a guide for
media arts students in understanding how to find and use free and open
source software.

Young-ciceros-path is the beginnings of an autobiographical
explication of one approach to navigating the arts/programming divide.

All very much a work in progress!

PS. Note that internal links that work within org-mode and within a normal browser-rendered HTML file work. The script that processes .org files for viewing within Github, however, does not translate the links correctly. Caveat!

See [this discussion](https://github.com/wallyqs/org-ruby/issues/11) for more on wonky links
