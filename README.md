# What is this project about?

This project began as an outline--in org mode (which allows easy
conversion to html)--of a guide for media arts students in
understanding how to find and use free and open source software.

The outline, which is contained as "primary" doc, is quite evidently a
work in progress. What does that mean, exactly, for someone looking to
get something out of it?

## Prolegomena

Well, because it is perhaps overly ambitious (hence the whole quirky
Kant "prolegomena" business), it makes sense to begin thinking about
how having a sense of "the big picture" might help one make sense of
it all. And who is that "one?"

Please see the [READMEs of the primary docs](https://github.com/cicerojones/FOSS-media-arts-guide/tree/master/primary-docs) and secondary docs,
respectively, in order to begin getting a sense of the scope and more
specific purpose of all this. For now.

### *One* Path
Well, for now, in the secondary docs, the file "Young-ciceros-path" is
the beginnings of an autobiographical explication of one approach to
navigating the arts/programming divide--i.e. one example of one person
(an "artist" for lack of a better term) trying to make sense of this
much-vaunted big picture.
