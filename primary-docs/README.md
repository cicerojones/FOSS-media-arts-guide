# What is a Prolegomena?

It is a fancy name for an attempt. Or the lead up to an attempt. Like
a prologue.

## What are we attempting here?

Put simply--To become artists who know a thing or two about software.

## Why or how should we do that?

Maybe click on [prolegomena-to-any-future.org](link) for starters.
Then also, look at [secondary-docs](link), where there's a more
leisurely and discursive--yet organized!--environment for thinking
about learning to program as an artist.
