# What is a Prolegomena?

It is a fancy name for an attempt. Or the lead up to an attempt. Like
a prologue.

## What are we attempting here?

Put simply--To become artists who know a thing or two about software.

## Why or how should we do that?

Maybe click on [prolegomena-to-any-future.org](https://github.com/cicerojones/FOSS-media-arts-guide/blob/master/primary-docs/prolegomena-to-any-future.org) for starters.
Then also, look at [secondary-docs](https://github.com/cicerojones/FOSS-media-arts-guide/tree/master/secondary-docs/README.md), where there's a more
leisurely and discursive--yet organized!--introduction to the environment for thinking
about learning to program as an artist. Phew...

### Note--the Hiccups and the Quizzical

Let's just get this out of the way--this is not necessarily the best
way to do all this! Github does render .org files with some markup,
but internal links, which work fine if you are reading an org file in
emacs, do not work as such.

Additionally, there's so much information, all gathered on one page,
that you would do well to ask if there weren't a better way to
organize it all, so that navigation would be easier. For now, pure
expediency prevails. I welcome your efforts in that direction!
