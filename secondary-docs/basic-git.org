* How To Fork and Make Pull Requests

To paraphrase Cheap Trick, I want you to want to help me!

Here are some basic steps. There are some basic prereqs:

- familiarity with the command line
- very basic awareness of git (it needs to be installed)
- an existing fork of this project
- more than mild forebearance :)

One does not automatically just learn how to do this stuff. You may
need to guidance, and experience playing around. [Links to come!]()

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone <url-of-your-fork> # you have the code on your local machine

# add original as a remote named upstream
git remote add --track master upstream https://github.com/cicerojones/FOSS-media-arts-guide.git

#add the 'upstream' (original project location) as a remote branch so
#that you can get their updates into your branch
git branch -a # to see if anything is going on behind the scenes
git fetch upstream # get /that/ code
git merge upstream/master # merge it to your own project (probably already up-to-date right now)
git branch featurebranch # switch off master to develop
git checkout featurebranch
git branch # confirm your branch situation
#+END_SRC
